## Summary

Clarify feature data layer ownership for tasks/projects/events before refactoring apps/api routes

## Notes

Current repo structure only has implemented data layer in `packages/features/notes`.
`apps/api/routes.ts` uses in-memory storage for tasks/projects/events, but feature
packages do not yet clarify ownership for those resources. This mapping is needed
before refactoring routes and storage to feature data layers.
