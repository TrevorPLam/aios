## Summary

The TASK-002 acceptance criteria require documenting all required environment variables from `env_validator.py`, but that file is not present in the repository. Please identify the canonical source for required environment variables.

## Required Human Action Steps

1. Confirm where `env_validator.py` lives (or the new canonical source if it has been renamed or removed).
2. Provide the authoritative list of required environment variables and which are production-only vs. development-only.
3. Confirm any required placeholder formats or example values for `.env.example`.

## Evidence of Completion

- Link or filepath to `env_validator.py` (or replacement) and any notes on required variables.
