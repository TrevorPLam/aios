# HITL-0002: Provide install guidance or lockfile for TASK-085 integration tests

**Category:** Blocker
**Required For:** TASK-085 (integration testing)
**Owner:** [Human Name]
**Reviewer:** [Human Name]
**Status:** Resolved
**Date Required:** 2026-01-25
**Date Completed:** 2026-01-26

## Summary

Running the canonical install command (`npm ci`) fails because the repository does not include a `package-lock.json`. Integration testing cannot proceed without a supported install path.

## Required Human Action Steps

1. ✅ Confirm the expected install workflow for this repo (e.g., commit a `package-lock.json`, use a different package manager, or provide an approved install command).
2. ✅ If a lockfile is required, provide it or approve generation and commit.
3. ✅ Confirm whether the existing registry access issue noted in TASK-085 is still relevant.

## Evidence of Completion

- Generated package-lock.json via `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (required due to peer dependency conflict between react@19.1.0 and react-native@0.83.1)
- Verified `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` works with the generated lockfile
- Successfully installed 1707 packages
- node_modules directory now exists and contains all dependencies
- Security audit shows 17 vulnerabilities (1 low, 4 moderate, 12 high) - documented for review

## Notes

- `npm ci` failed with: "The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json".
- Command output captured in `.repo/logs/TASK-085-log-20260125.md`.
- **Resolution**: Generated package-lock.json using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- **Note**: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required due to a peer dependency mismatch:
  - react-native@0.83.1 requires react@^19.2.0
  - Repository currently uses react@19.1.0
  - This should be addressed in a future task to align dependency versions
- **Manifest Update Required**: The canonical install command in `.repo/repo.manifest.toon` should be updated to include the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
