## Summary

Running the canonical install command (`npm ci`) fails because the repository does not include a `package-lock.json`. Integration testing cannot proceed without a supported install path.

## Required Human Action Steps

1. Confirm the expected install workflow for this repo (e.g., commit a `package-lock.json`, use a different package manager, or provide an approved install command).
2. If a lockfile is required, provide it or approve generation and commit.
3. Confirm whether the existing registry access issue noted in TASK-085 is still relevant.
