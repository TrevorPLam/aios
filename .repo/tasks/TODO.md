### [TASK-013] Fix API Server Boundary Violations
- **Priority:** P0
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Created:** 2026-01-23
- **Context:** `apps/api/` implements business logic instead of mounting from packages. Violates architecture rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Refactor all 42+ routes in `apps/api/routes.ts` to use feature data layers
- [ ] Remove business logic from `apps/api/storage.ts`
- [ ] Import from `@features/*/data` instead of local storage
- [ ] Verify no business logic remains in apps/api/
- [ ] Update tests to reflect new architecture

#### Notes
- Source: PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md section 2.1
- Start with one feature (e.g., notes) as proof of concept
- Requires feature data layers to be implemented first (TASK-014)
