  "evidence": [
    "server:dev now runs `tsx watch apps/api/index.ts` to auto-restart on changes.",
    "Documentation now states that server:dev runs in watch mode.",
    "Runtime validation of server:dev could not run because tsx is not installed in this environment."

  "decisions": [
    "Prioritized smaller stabilization tasks to deliver verifiable improvements quickly.",
    "Kept changes within existing module boundaries to avoid ADR triggers."
  ],
  "risks": [
    "npm install and follow-on checks are blocked by registry access restrictions.",
    "Boundary check requires lint-imports which cannot be installed in this environment."
  ],
  "follow_ups": [
    "Resolve npm registry access to run lint/typecheck/tests locally or in CI.",
    "Install lint-imports/import-linter to run boundary checks without waivers."

  "reasoning_summary": "Delivered three small, related tasks that reduce alias confusion, remove unsafe casts, and improve API dev ergonomics while documenting verification limits.",
  "notes": "No secrets. No private data. No raw chain-of-thought."
