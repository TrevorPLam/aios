  "plan": [
    "Add analytics client tests for offline queueing and retry handling in packages/platform/analytics/__tests__/client.test.ts.",
    "Add transport retry coverage in packages/platform/analytics/__tests__/transport.test.ts.",
    "Update task tracking in .repo/tasks/TODO.md with status and filepaths."
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Added AnalyticsClient tests covering queued events and retry count increments in packages/platform/analytics/__tests__/client.test.ts.",
    "Added Transport retry and no-retry assertions in packages/platform/analytics/__tests__/transport.test.ts.",
    "Updated TASK-085 status and notes with filepaths in .repo/tasks/TODO.md.",
    "Simplified AnalyticsClient tests to rely on timer cleanup instead of accessing private client internals."
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "npm install failed due to react/react-dom peer dependency conflict (see command: npm install).",
    "npm test failed because jest was unavailable before dependencies were installed (see command: npm test)."
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Captured offline queueing and retry behavior with unit tests in the analytics client and transport layers to meet Phase 0 criteria."
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Tests were not executed due to dependency resolution failure; rerun npm install and npm test in a configured environment."
  ],
  "follow_ups": [
    "Resolve npm install peer dependency conflict and rerun npm test to verify new analytics tests."
  ],
  "reasoning_summary": "Focused on adding explicit tests for offline queueing and retry behavior while updating task tracking, then adjusted client tests to avoid private method access by relying on timer cleanup.",
  "notes": "No secrets. No private data. Filepaths referenced: packages/platform/analytics/__tests__/client.test.ts, packages/platform/analytics/__tests__/transport.test.ts, .repo/tasks/TODO.md."
