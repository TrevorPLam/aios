# Archive

Archived TODO snapshots.

## Purpose

This directory preserves historical snapshots of TODO files when major changes occur or when a complete refactoring of task tracking happens.

## Format

Snapshots are named with the date they were archived:
- `TODO-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Root TODO file snapshot
- `P0TODO-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - P0 priority TODO snapshot
- etc.

## When to Archive

1. Before major refactoring of TODO structure
2. At major milestones or release points
3. When adopting new governance frameworks
4. When significant tasks are completed and need historical reference
