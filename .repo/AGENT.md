**All agent rules are in:** `.repo/policy/constitution.json`

**Read that file for complete rules, workflows, and policies.**

## Quick Start (Reading Order)

**Canonical reading order (per AGENTS.json):**

1. Read `.repo/tasks/TODO.md` - Current tasks (3-5 tasks, MUST READ FIRST)
2. Read `.repo/repo.manifest.yaml` - Commands (BEFORE ANY COMMAND)
3. Read `.repo/policy/constitution.json` - Rules (START HERE)
4. Follow three-pass workflow from `AGENTS.json`

**Procedures:** See `.repo/policy/procedures.json` for how-to instructions.

---

**For full policy context:** See `.repo/policy/CONSTITUTION.md` and `.repo/policy/PRINCIPLES.md`

**Note:** This is a single-agent system. You are the only agent working on tasks.
