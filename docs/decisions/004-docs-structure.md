# ADR-004: Documentation structure and governance

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-16

## Context

AIOS documentation spans architecture, security, planning, and technical references. Maintaining quality requires consistent structure, automation, and governance.

## Decision

Standardize documentation structure under `docs/`, add quality automation (lint/link/spell checks), and define review process expectations in contributor guidance.

## Consequences

- Improves discoverability via predictable locations and naming.
- Adds CI checks that enforce documentation health.
- Requires contributors to follow style guide and templates.
- Creates a repeatable review process that keeps docs current.
