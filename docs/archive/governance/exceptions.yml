# AIOS Governance Exceptions

# DEPRECATED: This file has been archived. The new HITL system uses /.repo/hitl/HITL-XXXX.md files.
# See /.repo/policy/HITL.md for the new system. This file is kept for historical reference only.

# This file tracks formal exceptions (waivers) to repository policies.
# All exceptions MUST have expiry dates and remediation plans.
# CI automatically checks for expired exceptions.

exceptions:
  # Example exception (commented out - uncomment and modify to use):
  # - id: EXC-001
  #   title: "Legacy analytics module lacks TypeScript types"
  #   description: |
  #     The apps/mobile/analytics/ module was written before TypeScript strict mode
  #     was enforced. It currently uses 'any' types in several places.

  #   created_date: "2026-01-18"
  #   expires_date: "2026-04-18"  # 90 days maximum
  #   policy_violated: "TypeScript strict mode requirement (constitution.md COPILOT:CLIENT #1)"
  #   remediation_plan_link: "https://github.com/TrevorPowellLam/Mobile-Scaffold/issues/123"
  #   status: active  # active | closed
  #   notes: |
  #     Plan: Convert 2-3 files per sprint to proper TypeScript.
  #     Target completion: 2026-04-15

# Schema:
# - id: Unique identifier (e.g., EXC-001, EXC-002)
# - title: Short description of the exception
# - description: Full explanation of why exception is needed
# - owner: GitHub username (@username) responsible for remediation
# - created_date: ISO 8601 date when exception was created
# - expires_date: ISO 8601 date when exception expires (max 90 days from created_date)
# - policy_violated: Reference to specific policy in constitution.md or other governance doc
# - remediation_plan_link: Link to GitHub issue or ADR describing how to resolve
# - status: "active" (currently in effect) or "closed" (resolved/no longer needed)
# - notes: Optional additional context or progress updates

# Guidelines:
# 1. Exceptions are temporary - max 90 days
# 2. If you need an extension, create a NEW exception with new justification
# 3. No permanent exceptions - if something can't be fixed, change the policy instead
# 4. Always link to a remediation plan (GitHub issue, ADR, or project)
# 5. CI will fail if any active exception is expired
# 6. Update status to "closed" when remediated (don't delete - keep for history)

# Current active exceptions: 0
