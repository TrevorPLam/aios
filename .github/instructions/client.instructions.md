### Client/Frontend Laws

**1. TypeScript Strict Mode (Mandatory)**
- No `any` types without explicit justification and TODO
- Full type coverage for all new code
- Document exceptions with `// @ts-expect-error: reason`

**2. Testing Requirements**
- All new features require tests (React Testing Library)
- New components: 80% coverage minimum
- Utility functions: 100% coverage expected
- Test user flows, not implementation details

**3. Error Handling**
- Use Error Boundaries for all screen-level components
- User-facing errors must be friendly, not technical
- Log errors for debugging but show friendly messages to users

**4. Accessibility (a11y) Mandatory**
- All interactive elements must have accessibility props
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- Color contrast minimums: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text

**5. Dependency Policy**
- Check security before adding dependencies
- Large deps (>100kb) require ADR
- Security-sensitive deps require ADR + security review
- Prefer existing libraries over new ones
