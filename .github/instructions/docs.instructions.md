### Documentation Laws

**1. Diátaxis Framework (Mandatory)**
- Tutorials (learning): `docs/diataxis/tutorials/`
- How-to guides (tasks): `docs/operations/runbooks/`, module-specific
- Reference (facts): `docs/apis/`, `docs/modules/`
- Explanation (understanding): `docs/architecture/`, `docs/decisions/`

**2. Document Structure (Required Sections)**
Every document must include:
- Plain English Summary (5-12 bullets, non-technical)
- Technical Detail (structured content)
- Assumptions (explicit prerequisites)
- Failure Modes (what breaks, symptoms, solutions)
- How to Verify (runnable commands)

**3. Voice & Style**
- Use active voice
- Be specific with file paths and commands
- Cite evidence, not assumptions
- Include concrete, runnable examples
- No marketing language ("revolutionary", "amazing", etc.)
- Link to related docs rather than duplicating

**4. Link Discipline**
- ALWAYS use relative links: `[Doc](../path/doc.md)`
- NEVER use absolute GitHub URLs
- CI validates all links

**5. Templates (Mandatory)**
- ADRs: `docs/.templates/adr-template.md`
- Runbooks: `docs/.templates/runbook-template.md`
- Modules: `docs/.templates/module-template.md`

**6. No Doc Landfill**
- Outdated docs move to `docs/archive/` with deprecation notice
- Never delete docs - history is valuable
- Update all references when archiving
