# Features Package

This package contains feature modules following Domain-Driven Design.

## Structure
Each feature follows this structure:
- `data/` - Data access layer (API calls, storage)
- `domain/` - Business logic and domain models
- `ui/` - UI components for the feature
- `index.ts` - Public exports

## Features
- alerts, budget, calendar, contacts, core, email, integrations, lists, messaging, notes, photos, planner, recommendations, settings, translator

## Guidelines
- Domain layer is framework-agnostic
- Data layer handles all I/O
- UI layer handles presentation
- Export through index.ts
