# Design System Package

This package provides the shared design system components, theme, and constants used across all applications.

## Structure
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `constants/` - Theme, UI constants
- `context/` - Theme context providers
- `hooks/` - Design system hooks (useTheme, useColorScheme)
- `utils/` - Design system utilities

## Usage
```typescript
import { Button, ThemedView, ThemedText } from '@aios/design-system'
import { useTheme } from '@aios/design-system/hooks'
```

## Guidelines
- Components should work across web and mobile (React Native)
- Use theme context for consistent styling
- Export all public APIs through index.ts
