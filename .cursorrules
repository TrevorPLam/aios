# Cursor Rules for AIOS

## Verify Command
Always run `make verify` before submitting changes.

## Coding Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Prefer functional components and hooks in React
- Use absolute imports from package roots

## Planning
Plan first for changes over 10 lines or 3+ files.

## Protected Paths
Never touch these without explicit approval:
- infrastructure/
- services/api-gateway/
- .github/workflows/
- scripts/
- package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, tsconfig.base.json

## Patterns
Prefer editing existing patterns over inventing new ones.
Follow the monorepo structure - shared code goes in packages/, app-specific code in apps/.
