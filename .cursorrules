# Cursor Rules for AIOS

Project: AIOS monorepo (pnpm + Turbo)

Commands:
- setup: make setup
- verify: make verify

Rules:
- Do not change protected paths without approval (see scripts/security/protected-paths.txt).
- Do not add dependencies without approval.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Plan first for changes over ~200 lines or more than 3 files.

Style:
- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components).
- Prefer functional components and hooks in React.
- Use absolute imports from package roots.
- Keep scripts in scripts/ and docs in docs/ or governance/.
